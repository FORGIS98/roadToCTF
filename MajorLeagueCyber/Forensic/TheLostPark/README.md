# The Lost Park
What is the name of this monument?

# Solution
Using the linux tool `exiftool` we can stract the metadata of the picture and we have the exact GPS location of the status (we can go use it in google maps) or we also find the `Country-Primary Location Name` with the name of the park. Then we search in google.
