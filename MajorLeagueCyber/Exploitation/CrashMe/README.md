# Crashme
Can you make this program crash?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
    char buffer[32];
    printf("Give me some data: \n");
    fflush(stdout);
    fgets(buffer, 64, stdin);
    printf("You entered %s\n", buffer);
    fflush(stdout);
    return 0;
}

Once you figure out how to make the program crash, the binary is running on challenges.hackerfire.com on port 30002. If you can crash it there, you'll receive the flag!

Run nc challenges.hackerfire.com 30002 to connect! Or download PuTTY and use Raw mode to connect.

If you want to see a compiled version of the program, it's attached below.

# Solution
So, the buffer can store up to 32 Bytes, and the standar input up to 64. So to crash the program, the easy way is to write a lot of numbers `12345678901234567890...` this will make the program crash and give a segmentation fault (core dumped) error. That mean you overflow the memory.

Then, you are suposed to use the command `nc challenges.hackerfire.com 30002` to connect to the server I guess and do the same thing and you'll get the flag. But I'm not capable of connecting to them. I've run a `nmap -Pn challenges.hackerfire.com` and port 30000 is open...but can't do anything so.
