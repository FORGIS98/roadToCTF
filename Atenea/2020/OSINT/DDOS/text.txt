Hi folk! Are you ready??

To compile: gcc ddos3r.c -w -o ddos3r -lpthread

./ddos3r target threads proxy time ip

Pay attention on IRC (Freenode / Rizon), we will tell the exact time at 00:00 (same channel), The operation is coming!!!!

Modified versi√≥n (DDOSER AMEA v12.31). Remember to change usual things (IP, port, user-agent, etc.) before compiling :D
